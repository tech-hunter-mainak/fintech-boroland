      question: 'Does It Affect My CIBIL Score?',

      id: '3',
      question: 'How Often Can I Check?',

      question: 'What Makes This Different from Traditional Credit Scores?',
      answer: 'Our system is specifically designed for the Bodo community, considering factors like traditional skills, seasonal income patterns, and community references. We understand that traditional credit scores might not reflect the true creditworthiness of Bodo individuals.'
